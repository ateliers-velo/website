Bikes Unite Montreal invites all bike co-op people to a 5 à 7! It’ll take place at Ma Brasserie (2300 Holt street) on November 3th. It will be a rare occasion where we can meet people from other co-ops! And to have fun!

Besse is planning a Show n’ Tell moment, so please bring something (rare part, DIYed tool, co-op mascot, anything funny) you’d like to say a word or two about. One or more per co-op.

Alsooooooooo there WILL be a piñata.

Psssst! Bikes Unite Montreal is the federation of the Mtl bike co-ops.
