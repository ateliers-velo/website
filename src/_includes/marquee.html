  <!-- It doesn't work and it makes me sad :(
Shit I have tried: 

import "./main.css"; 

 <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
  </head>

Before copying the CSS in the file, see below, but it still doesn't work at all
I am clearly missing something and I can't see it or figure it out. 
Git hub doesn't seem to recognize "marquee-move-text" as a symbol... piste?

Please let me know:
1 - what you do to get it to work 
2 - how you figured it out

Best - Gaba -->

Hi Gaba,

Here's what was wrong and how I fixed it:

1. The file was using React/JSX syntax (className, JS style objects, etc.), but this is a plain HTML file for Eleventy/static site, not a React app. Browsers don't understand JSX.
2. I replaced all `className` with `class` (standard HTML).
3. I replaced the JS style objects with valid inline CSS using the `style` attribute, e.g.:
     style="--direction: reverse; --speed: 20s;"
4. Now the CSS custom properties (variables) are set correctly for each marquee track.
5. This should now work as intended, as long as the file is included in a page and the CSS is present (which it is, since it's in a <style> block at the top).

How I figured it out: Browsers only understand HTML, not JSX. If you see curly braces, className, or JS objects in a .html file, that's a sign it was copied from a React/JSX context. Just use standard HTML attributes.

Let me know if you need more help!
